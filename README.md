## Description

The goal of this project is to develop a front-end application for Noroff's online auction API, allowing users to register, list items for bidding, and engage in auctions seamlessly. Candidates must demonstrate their ability to plan, develop and document a dynamic, interactive solution for a specific target group. The back-end API will be provided and the candidate is responsible for implementing a high-quality front-end that integrates with it.
